# Site Overview
Genquality is a website built as a project for September's Hackathon with Code Institute, Deloitte and Trust in Soda. The theme given was 'Closing the gender gap' and so we decided a good way to tackle this issue was with an educational and enlightening quiz, along with some resources and information on how the user can make a difference.

## Goal
The goal of our website is to see how aware the user really is about the gender gap. Some users might be shocked by some of the facts and statistics, while others may not. For those with less knowledge about the topic, we want to provide resources where they can learn more and also how they can help close the gap in their workplace and their life. The overall aim of this project is to bring awareness to the inequality in workplaces, each gender being affected in different ways.

## User Stories

## Features

### Existing Features

### Future Features

## Design
We went into this project with the aim of being unbiased to any gender, and also making the information as clear and concise as possible. 

### Wireframes

[Wireframe](project_files/wireframes/wireframe.png)

### Typography

For our fonts, we decided to use 'Karla', a sans serif font, and 'Inconsolata'. We felt these two fonts complimented each other well; the simplicity of 'Inconsolata' helping us portray our information as factual and official.

### Images

Images that were used varied from stock images of co-workers, to protest signs and cartoon illustrations. We wanted to show all the different sides to this topic and we feel the images we've chosen show this.

### Colour Scheme

For our colour scheme, we used coolors.co to generate a palette that we felt was neutral enough not to bias any particular gender, and was also light enough that text and other images would contrast well with the colours.

* [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/) was also used for git version control when working locally from my PC.
